# TTT2Jailor

DISCLAIMER: This role needs additional addons to work! See below!

DISCLAIMERÂ²: This role isn't really suited for public servers (yet), see 'Jailor's Baton'.

This is the Jailor for TTT2.

The Jailor is an Innocent who wields two special items to help isolate and find the baddies:

    The Collar Gun, a Deagle that attaches an explosive collar to players! If they move too far away from the Jailor (or vice versa), they start beeping and explode. Press 'Reload' to either free all players or detonate all collars!

and

    The Jailor's Baton, which you can use to jail people for 30 seconds!
    
    // DISCLAIMER: The Jailor's Baton is literally just an edited version of the Adminstick that can't do anything but do "ulx jail" and locks it to 30 seconds. This means that it DOESN'T WORK unless players have access to ulx commands. In short: If you play with 5 friends and make all players admins, that's cool. Obviously, this is not an option with public servers / strangers! If you still want to use the role, remove the baton from the Jailor's loadout by removing the respective hook in the baton code.

Required Addons:
